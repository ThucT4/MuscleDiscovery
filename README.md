# Muscle Discovery
### COSC2659 - Group Assignment 

The given theme in this semester is Discovery and the team decides to implement unique app designs that suit to a wide range of users and demands, named Muscle Discovery. 

Our team chose to develop the Muscle Discovery app, which falls under the fitness topic, as our inspiration for this project. We believe that fitness is an important aspect of well-being and health, and that it relates to the keyword theme of "Discorvery". By using our app, users can  achieve their fitness goals, whether they are beginners or experts. Our app connects users to personal trainers who can provide personalized guidance and feedback, as well as a tool to calculate the macro of calories of different foods. This way, users can monitor their nutrition and exercise habits and optimize their results. We hope that our app can help users discover their potential and improve their quality of life.
